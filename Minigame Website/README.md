# Mini Games Website

A browser-based mini-games website built with **vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
The project groups multiple classic games into a single interface and focuses on DOM manipulation, event-driven programming, and basic game state management.

This project was originally built locally and later refactored to follow cleaner project structure and separation of concerns.
