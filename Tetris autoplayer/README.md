# Tetris Autoplayer

An automated Tetris player implemented in Python.  
The project focuses on decision-making logic for selecting optimal piece placements based on the current board state.

## Overview
This project implements a Tetris autoplayer that evaluates possible moves for each incoming piece and selects the action that optimizes a heuristic score. The goal is to play Tetris autonomously by minimizing holes, managing stack height, and maximizing line clears.

The project was built as a standalone experiment in algorithmic decision-making and game logic.

## Key Features
- Rule-based decision engine for move selection
- Board evaluation using heuristic scoring
- Modular structure for readability and experimentation
- Designed to be easily extendable with improved heuristics or learning-based approaches
